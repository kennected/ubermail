# NOTE: We don't permanently redirect clients to the HTTPS address because some clients, like
# Thunderbird, dont't follow redirections to the HTTPS URL.
#
# Additionally, documentation doesn't say whether the XML file should be served over either HTTP,
# HTTPS or both, even though only the former is mentioned. Still, we allow clients to choose
# between HTTP and HTTPS transports.
